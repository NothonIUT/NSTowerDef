# **Project Overview :**

NSTowerDef is a tower defense video game made with Unity. This game is developped as our final project for our Bachelor in computer science.
Our goal is to learn how to use C# and Unity's tools and use this knowledge to create a fun and engaging game. 
Our dev team is composed of 5 students and we have a total of 6 weeks to finish the game. Therefore, our top priority is to establish the core of the game and then to add more content and work on the look of the game.

A Tower Defense is a type of video game where monsters walk down a path. The goal of the player is to get rid of the monsters before the reach the end of the path. 
To do so, he must buy and place turrets along the path and/or use special powers. Of course, there are many types of turrets and many types of ennemies with different caracteristics.
Ennemies come wave by wave and each wave gets harder. It's a strategical type of game that can be way harder than it looks.

Our team is composed of : @NothonIUT, @FlorestanHM, @BrettBeck, @YoannMerlet and @Kantun35

# **Main Features :**

The player must be able to : 
- Buy turrets and place them where he wants on the field
- Sell turrets
- Use special powers during the game

Those actions require multiple other features :
- An economical system (when a monster dies, the player earns money and can use it to buy more turrets)
- A shop where the player can use his money
- A preview of what ennemies are coming
- A preview of the caracteristics of turrets and special powers

# **Future Updates**

We already plan on adding multiples other features to the game :
- Upgrade system for turrets
- "Endless" game mode
- Better graphics and sound design in general
- More levels, more turrets, more ennemies, more power

If you have any idea on how we could improve our game, feel free to contact any member of the team.
